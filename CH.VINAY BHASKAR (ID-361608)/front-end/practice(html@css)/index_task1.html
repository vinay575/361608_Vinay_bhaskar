<h1> This Is An Practice </h1>
<h3>This is Lorem Text</h3>
<p><span style="color:blue">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</span>
 Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, 
 when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. 
 <strong style="color:red">It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, 
 remaining essentially unchanged.</strong>It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset 
 sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software 
 like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
